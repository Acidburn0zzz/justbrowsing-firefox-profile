Designed for the Australis update to Firefox.","fullDescription":"Do you love to profile things? Do you love to make profiles? Well that makes you a Profilist. This addon is for you.\n\nCompatibility for Portable Firefox\nThis release here will not work on portable versions of Firefox. There is a seperate release for portable, it is located here: ProfilistPortable\n\nInspiration\nAustralis came and it didn't have a beautiful Profile Manager. Right when I opened the panel I thought it would be so beautiful to show right above the footer what profile you're in. It made sense as right below it, is what account the profile is synced to, and a \"?\" button that gives you infromation on the profile installation.\n\nI hope one day to discontinue this addon because Mozilla adapts it officially, and of course improve upon it, like prettier CSS and images. Read more about the inspiration behind Profilist at the Profilist Developer Page\n\nFeatures\n\n    Launch Profile - All profiles are listed in the menu, hover over it and click on the one you would like to launch. If the profile is already open you will get a message that says it is already open, it will also say it think it's not responding but ignore that part, it's responding fine.\n    Create Profile - Hover over the menu and click on \"Create New Profile\", this will create and launch a profile named \"Unnamed Profile #\". You can then rename it to whatever you would like. On create of new profile it prompts you asking if you want to install Profilist into this new profile.\n    Rename Profile - Can rename profiles if they are in use or not. Can use any and all characters in the name. Hover over the menu, put your mouse over the profile you want to rename and click and hold (for active profile just click), after a short time you will get a prompt box. Rename to whatever you like.\n    Delete Profile - Can only delete profiles if they are not in use; if it is in use it will throw an exception message. To delete a profile, put your mouse over its name and click and hold on the profile item in the menu (for active profile just click). In the prompt, erase the name from the field and click \"OK\". You will get a confirmation message, and once confirm, it will delete the profile and all of its files.\n\n\nFuture Plans\nThere are some improvements I plan to implement. Find out about the details at the Profilist Development Page.\n\nCredits\nStephen Hutchings for Icons\n\nNotes for Nerds\nDesign with browser performance in mind, using the latest technologies from the Mozilla team, this addon is fully asynchronous. The only synchronous part is where I lock profile paths to test if it is in use, I will update this to the async method when it becomes available. Thus the addon does not rely on nsIToolkitProfileService, it uses OS.File.\n\nBug Reports\nFeel free to leave bug reports in the feedback/reviews section. You can also submit them at the Profilist bug tracking support system at GitHub.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/133/133570.png?src=api&modified=1396865128","width":"608","height":"525","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/133/133570.png?src=api&modified=1396865128","thumbnailWidth":"174","thumbnailHeight":"150","caption":"Profilist menu in collapsed state.

This addon simply removes that redirection and turns every search result in its original link, saving your time and giving you more security.\n\nWorks on results accessed from http://google.com or https://google.com (and any country variation like google.es, google.co.uk and so on) and from the Firefox search box, works on regular results and Google Blogs, Google News, Google Recipes, Google Images, Google Videos and even using encrypted.google.com.\n\nIt also cleans up all the links you copy & paste from google search results pages. This is one is a feature most users are looking for and other similar addons don't have.\n\nHow it works (and why it works that way)\n\nWhen I first developed this addon, it worked by changing every single link in every google search result page you load. This is quite expensive (for the browser) and in some cases (like Google Image Search when you scroll down several times and that loads a lot of images) the browser performance get downgraded.\n\nSo the addon does not modifies every google search results links in a page anymore: it waits till you click one of them (left, right or middle button click) or till you open a new tab and paste an url in the url bar: then the addon intercepts the network request (if it is a google redirect) and fixes it and does the request to the final url.\n\nIt's a little complex and not intuitive, but I've found that this is the way to go. Other addons fail when you paste a google result link with a redirect because they only work when you click on it or when you copy it.\n\nI hope it helps you understand the way the addon works.\n\nFeedback\n\nPlease give me feedback as much as you can and suggest features. I'll be maintaining and supporting this addon since it proved to be usefull for the community. I'll be glad to hear from you.

On MacOSX these tabs have also a reversed appearance like on Firefox 28.\n\nApplication button / application menu settings\n\nApplication menu titlebar button [Windows only]\nThe appmenu titlebar button is fixed on titlebars left side like on it was since Fx 4.0. It is enabled by default on Windows systems.\n\nApplication menu toolbar button\nThe appmenu toolbar button is a default toolbar menu button and can be placed on any available toolbar.\nIf it is moved to tabs toolbar while the menubar is disabled, the appbutton appears on browsers titlebar (Windows only). Otherwise it appears like a default toolbar button placed on any toolbar.\n\nApplication button colors\nOn tabs toolbar and on titlebar the appbutton can be colored orange, blue (Aurora), black (Nightly), transparent, blue (Palemoon), red, green and gray [in normal browsing mode] and purple [in private browsing mode] like on previous Windows browser versions.\n\nNote\nThe new appmenu is not an exact copy of the old one, but looks as original as possible. The 'splitmenu' are not yet restored, so menuitems and a submenus are placed in a row now. The appmenu also misses some non-cloneable menuitems.\n\nSmall nav-bar buttons\nNavigation toolbar buttons get alternative margins and paddings to simulate small icon view.\n\nHide 'Navigation Toolbar'\nHiding nav-bar might be interesting after its items get moved to other toolbars.\n\n'Add-on Bar'\nA toolbar at windows bottom simulates the 'old' add-on bar. All movable buttons and items can be placed on it. Add-on bar can be accessed using toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar) or can be toggled using 'Ctrl+/' (Windows/Linux) btw. 'Cmd+/' (MacOSX).\n\n'Additional Toolbar'\nAnother toolbar below top toolbars, where buttons and items can be moved to. It can be accessed through toolbars context menu (right-click on an existing toolbar).\n\nFindbar on top/bottom\nForces findbar to be displayed on top or on the bottom.\n\nIcons + text\nDisplay text below toolbar buttons.\n\nText only\nReplace toolbar button icons with text.\n\nBookmarks menu button\nThe bookmarks menu button is a default 'toolbar menu button'. Placed on bookmarks toolbar it also shoes a label next to the icon.\n\nBookmarks sidebar button\nThe bookmarks sidebar button toggles the bookmarks sidebar.\n\nHistory sidebar button\nThe history sidebar button toggles the history sidebar.\n\nBack-forward, reload and stop buttons\nBrowsers default buttons got merged with urlbar and cannot be moved to different toolbar positions or to different toolbars. CTB recreates these buttons.\n\nCombined reload-stop button\nPlace reload button AFTER stop button and enable the corresponding option on CTRs preference window. Hovering the option on preference window to get extra information.\nToolbar: [something]...[stop-button][reload-button]...[something]\n\nSpaces and flexible spaces\nA couple of toolbar items simulate spaces and flexible spaces. They can be moved to toolbars like toolbar buttons using browsers customize menu.\n\nWindows - Linux - MacOSX\nThis add-on was tested on Windows 7 (AeroBasic, AeroGlass, Classic) & 8 & XP (Classic, Luna-Blue/Silver/Olive, Zune, Royale), Linux Mint KDE, Ubuntu and MacOSX 10.8/10.9. On other Systems or non OS-default themes tab colors may look wrong. Bookmarks, history, stop, reload, back and forward toolbar buttons use default OS icons (Firefox Windows icons on Windows systems, Firefox Mac icons on MacOSX and Firefox Linux icons on Linux systems).\n\nKnown major problems\nThe add-on Foxtab (v1.0-1.4.11) breaks Firefox ui on Fx29+, because it is not compatible to Fx29+. Using it along with CTR breaks the ui even more. It is strongly recommended to remove Foxtab before upgrading to Firefox 29 or newer.\nIf Foxtab is/gets installed and add-ons manager is still accessible, remove both CTR and Foxtab. After a restart CTR can be installed again and will work properly.\n\nKnown 'issues'/'glitches'/extra info\n1) Application menus 'cut', 'copy' and 'paste' buttons do not always work like they should.\n2) Switching between AeroGlass and AeroBasic on Windows 7/Vista can change application buttons position, if the menubar is disabled. Maximizing/restoring browsers main window or restarting Firefox reslves the problem. This glitch is caused by MS Windows and titlebars behavior and not by this add-on.\n3) Tab colors on MacOSX fit to current ui instead of using pre-Australis colors. This is intended and not a bug.\n\nNotes\n1) Do not install this add-on on pre-Australis Firefox (4-28). It is not intended to be used with older versions.\n2) This add-on was made for browsers default theme and will not work properly with all full/complete themes. However most Personas (= [non-complete/light] Themes since 2013) should work fine.","isPlatformCompatible":true,"eula":null,"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/full/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1404832319","width":"167","height":"125","thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/img/uploads/previews/thumbs/118/118349.png?src=api&modified=1404832319","thumbnailWidth":"167","thumbnailHeight":"125","caption":"Main

It means that you can change default behavior of commands in Firefox and addons (menu items, toolbar button, etc.) from opening an interface in window to opening it in sidebar or tab.\n\nSupported windows (possible to change in options):\n\n    Firefox Library (Bookmarks, History and Downloads). All ways to open Library are supported (including Downloads Panel and Downloads Complete notification)\n    View Page Source including viewing source of frames\n    Firefox Options (it uses built-in Firefox feature that is hidden in prefs)\n    Page Info\n    Scratchpad\n    DOM Inspector\n    DownThemAll!\n    ChatZilla\n    XUL editor, Javascript Shell from Developer Assistant addon\n    and many others, see screenshots for full list.\n\n\nIt is possible to add own windows to open them in sidebar or tab?\n\nGenerally yes but this addon can't support all windows and this feature is rather for advanced users. Many of them may be broken when opened in sidebar or tab or even affect stability of Firefox.\n\nHow to add own windows to open them in sidebar or tab?\n\nFirst of all you need enable \"Advanced Mode\" in Options dialog. It will cause show two new options: a \"Capture Mode\" checkbox and \"New Rule\" button. By click \"New Rule\" you can create own rule. You need specify URL of window whose attemp of opening, will cause chosen action (open in tab, sidebar). You can get the url of window by opening it in normal way and inspect it by DOM Inspector. The easier way is temporary enabling \"Capture Mode\" which \"captures\" every (almost) window opening attempt (by clicking a button, clicking a menu item, ..). Then you can try open the window you want to open it in tab or sidebar.
